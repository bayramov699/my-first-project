        <p>It is a hacker group.Anonymous originated in 2003 on the
            imageboard 4chan representing the concept of many online and offline community users
            simultaneously existing as an anarchic, digitized global brain. Anonymous members
            (known as Anons) can be distinguished in public by the wearing of Guy Fawkes masks
            in the style portrayed in the graphic novel and film V for Vendetta. However,
            this may not always be the case as some of the collective prefer to instead cover
            their face without using the well-known mask as a disguise. Some anons also opt
            to mask their voices through voice changers or text-to-speech programs.</p>
